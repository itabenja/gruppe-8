  <div class="chart-box" style="width: 1160px;"> <p>The Transition to Renewable Energy: A Global Shift

    As we look towards a sustainable future, the shift from primary energy sources like fossil fuels to renewable energy is more critical than ever. Currently, only [X]% of the worldâ€™s Total energy consumption comes from renewable sources, a number that is steadily growing. However, the transition is still in its early stages. While wind, solar, and hydropower continue to lead the charge, the global energy landscape remains heavily reliant on non-renewable sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

    Why This Matters
    Every percentage point gained in renewable energy is a step closer to mitigating climate change, reducing global pollution, and building a cleaner, more resilient energy future. The road ahead is challenging, but with continued investment, innovation, and global collaboration, we can accelerate the transition to a world powered by clean, renewable energy.

    Together, we can create a sustainable future. The question is: How much further can we go?. </p>

    <p>Why Algeria and Iceland Differ in Renewable Energy Use

    The stark difference in renewable energy use between Algeria and Iceland highlights the impact of geography, resources, and policies on energy strategies. Iceland benefits from abundant geothermal and hydropower resources due to its volcanic activity and high water availability, enabling it to rely almost entirely on renewable energy. In contrast, Algeria, located in the arid Sahara region, lacks access to significant hydropower or geothermal resources and has historically depended on its vast fossil fuel reserves, like oil and natural gas, for energy.
  
    Such disparities reflect broader global trends. Geography determines the availability of renewable resources like wind, solar, and water. Economic priorities, energy infrastructure, and government policies also shape how countries harness and prioritize renewable energy. Together, these factors create significant variations in renewable energy adoption worldwide.
